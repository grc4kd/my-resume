# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# This workflow will install Deno then run `deno lint` and `deno test`.
# For more information see: https://github.com/denoland/setup-deno

# Workflow Notes
# 1. Workflow defines a single job named `test`
# 2. Uses a custom environment named `workflow` running on `ubuntu-latest`
# 3. Sets environment variables for debug tests on GitHub runners / App Check debug token
# 4. Runs linting with Deno first to stop if there are any detectable code quality issues
# 5. Runs `npm ci` for a clean install of node dependencies using the `workflow` Angular configuration
# 6. Builds the Angular project in test job working directory
# 7. This workflow file does _not_ deploy the project. That's handled under deployments.
